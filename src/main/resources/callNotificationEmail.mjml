          What is Project Grand Canyon?
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text font-size="20px">
          Project Grand Canyon is an effort by volunteers from Citizens' Climate Lobby to inspire as many people as possible to call their Member of Congress and express their concern about climate change.
          <br/><br/> Congressional staffers and representatives have told us nothing is more powerful in helping a representative know what their constituents want than written letters and phone calls.
          <br/>
          <br/> Based on this fact, we created Project Grand Canyon. Just as the Grand Canyon was excavated one water drop at a time, our Members of Congress' resistance to climate solutions will be worn down by the drip, drip, drip of thousands of phone
          calls per month.</mj-text>
