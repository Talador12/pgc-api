# GrandCanyon project

## Background
API for [projectgrandcanyon.com](projectgrandcanyon.com), a project of [CCL](citizensclimatelobby.org) volunteers, that provides a way to help people call their Member of Congress about climate change on a regular basis.

###Using a locally running MySQL Database
1. Install and Run Docker
 * MacOS
     - Download from [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
 * Windows
     * Verify that virtualization is turned on on your computer: Enter Task Manager. Switch to the performance tab at top, and check if Virtualization is enabled. If Virtualization is not enabled, turn off your computer, access your  computer bios (command key may vary by machine). In the bios there should be an option to turn on Virtualization setting in bios.
     * [Download and install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ "Download and install Docker Desktop"): If you are unable to simply download and run the installer, begin troubleshooting by verifying that your computer meets the system requirements for Docker.
     * Run Docker Desktop: An icon should appear on your taskbar. If you are unable to start docker try opening docker settings by right clicking on the icon and selecting settings then turning on “Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS” setting. You can verify that docker is working properly by running `docker hello-world`
2. Create the mysql container by executing `docker run --name pgc-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pw -d -p 3306:3306 mysql`
 * You can verify that the container is there by running `docker ps`
 * You can access the container using: 
 `$docker exec -it pgc-mysql /bin/bash` 
 `$mysql -h localhost -P 3306 --protocol=tcp -u root -ppw`
3. Initialize the database: 
`$docker cp src/main/createTables.sql pgc-mysql:/`
`$docker exec -it pgc-mysql` 
`$mysql -u root -ppw < createTables.sql`
4. Download and install Maven:
 * MacOS
      * Use manual [install instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) or use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install with `brew install maven`(
   https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi): Follow the [installation instructions]
 * [Download for Windows](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). 
      * You must update the `PATH` environment variable to include `apache-maven-3.6.3/bin`. On windows this can be accessed by searching for `Advanced System Settings`, then switching to the advanced tab, selecting environment variables button, highlighting the `PATH` variable, clicking edit, clicking new, then finding the directory (probably in `Program Files` or `Program Files x86`). 
5. [Download Java 8 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
 * Similar to Maven, we also need to change an environment variable to reflect this new Download. Open your computer’s environment variables again, look for the variable called `JAVA_HOME` and change it to the Java 8 JDK.
 * Also, open Intellij and go to file->Project Structure (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+S). Click on JDK’s and select Java 1.8. 
6. Use `mvn clean jetty:run` to run the app.

###Using a shared CloudSQL Database
1. Create a [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) account, download gcloud, and authenticate
2. Ask maintainers to be added to GCP IAM for access to the database. Also ask for access to `config.properties` and `sentry.properties` files, which contain application settings and secrets
3. Place `config.properties` and `sentry.properties` files in `src/main/resources/` directory
4. Run the command: `mvn clean jetty:run -DINSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME=instanceConnectionName -Duser=root -Dpassword=myPassword -Ddatabase=myDatabase` where instanceConnectionName is the Instance connection name for the CloudSQL instance, myPassword is the DB root user's password, and myDatabase is the database name.

The application expects to connect to a Google CloudSQL database. The database URL is defined by the sqlUrl property in pom.xml.

###API Sessions
1. [Install Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
2. Install Newman using `npm install newman`
 * This step requires `npm` to be installed. It should install by default when you download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Create a SuperAdmin by running `newman run src/test/InitSuperAdmin.postman_collection.json`
4. Find the id for the super admin by:
`$docker exec -it pgc-mysql mysql -u root -ppw 'USE core; SELECT * FROM admins;'`
`$docker exec -it pgc-mysql mysql -u root -ppw 'UPDATE admins SET login_enabled = 1 WHERE admin_id = {admin id};'`
6. Populate the database with data using `newman run src/test/DummyData.postman_collection.json -e src/test/Data.postman_environment.json`
 * This step also initializes an admin. To login using this admin use  the username 'admin' and the password 'password'

###Modifying Automated Emails
1. Emails can be found in the `src/main/resources` folder. 
2. To edit an email, copy the contents of the  `emailName.mjml` into a [convenient mjml editor](https://mjml.io/try-it-live).
3. Then copy both the modified `emailName.mjml` and the resulting `emailName.html` back into their appropriate files. 

###Deployment
Run this command: `mvn clean appengine:deploy -DINSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME=instanceConnectionName -Duser=root -Dpassword=myPassword -Ddatabase=myDatabase`
 
For a local MySQL Database, instanceConnectionName = `pgc-mysql`, myPassword = `pw`, and myDatabase = `core`.
